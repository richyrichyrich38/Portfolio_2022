# Portfolio 2022

## Discription

I wanted to build a personal portfolio site that would be easy on the eye, minimalistic with a fluid design that is responsive to various screen sizes and devices.

I used orangered to complement the orange sunset background image I used which I also layered with an opacity of black to give it an end of dusk/early evening feel allowing it to not pull focus from the content written in solid white and bold placed orangered accents.

I learned a lot from adding the different CSS elements and personal touches such as using using :hover to add some design to the nav bar with the floating orangered left to right underline bar fill and a similar thing with the button on the page. One of the trickiest things regarding the main design was for the projects page where I used html and css to build a fluid carousel with links to my previous work without the use of Javascript.

Another issue that popped up which I didnt realise I had was a vast amount of white space on the right and bottom which after an hour or 2 of googling figured out it was just a matter of adding overflow: hidden; in the correct place!

Regarding making the site responsive, I really felt I had to dig deep to figure out why media queries wasn't working and adjusting my site in the manner I wanted. this required me going over my CSS code with a fine tooth comb which was very time consuming but gratifying once I had figured it out.

This was a first attempt but I hope you guys like it! A lesson I learned from this which I hpe to implement in the future, is to try and get the mechanics of the site working perfectly first and then focus on the visuals after as by doing it the other way round I feel I spent too much time focusing on the visuals leaving me chasing my tail a little to get everything completed functionality wise.
